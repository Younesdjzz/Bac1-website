### 🌟 Celestia Airlines — Dynamic Website Project ✈️

**🎓 Project Context:**
This is my first-year Bachelor's project, focused on the theme of **navigation** 🧭. The project is a dynamic website called **Celestia Airlines**, designed to provide detailed info about flights, airports, and air travel carbon emissions 🌍.

**👩‍💻 My Role:**
I mainly worked on the **front-end view**, crafting the **HTML and CSS** to build a clean, user-friendly interface across multiple pages 🖥️✨.

**🌐 Website Features and Pages:**

* **👥 Team Page:**
Shows the team and their roles, when clicking the three dashes (☰) next to a member, you can see more info about them and their Discord ID.

* **📊 Statistics:**
  Displays data from the database in clear tables, helping users easily explore flight statistics.

* **📈 Graphs:**

  * On the **left side**: Two bar charts — one for total emissions of the 4 big Belgian airports, another for comparative emissions, giving users a global view.
  * On the **right side**: An interactive pie chart where users select departure airport and dates to see emission shares by country, plus the total carbon footprint.

* **🏢 Airports:**
  Enter an airport to get daily flight info and types of aircraft flying there.

* **🌿 Emissions:**
  Shows flights departing from Belgium’s 4 main airports, including distance, flight numbers, and CO₂ emissions. Provides the total carbon footprint for each major airport.

* **💬 Your Opinion:**
  A community page created by our group where users can share their thoughts and feedback about the website — encouraging user engagement and improvement!
