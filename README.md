### 🌟 Celestia Airlines — Dynamic Website Project ✈️

**🎓 Project Context:**
This is my first-year Bachelor's project, focused on the theme of **navigation** 🧭. The project is a dynamic website called **Celestia Airlines**. Using Flask, a Python web framework, it is designed to provide detailed info about flights, airports, and air travel carbon emissions 🌍.

**👩‍💻 My Role:**
I mainly worked on the **front-end view**, crafting the **HTML and CSS** to build a clean, user-friendly interface across multiple pages 🖥️✨.

**🌐 Website Features and Pages:**

* **🏠 Home Page:**
  A simple welcome page introducing Celestia Airlines. It includes a disclaimer about image copyrights.
